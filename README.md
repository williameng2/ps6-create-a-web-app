# Deviations in Temperature (in deg. celcius) from the Average Temperature of 1991-2020

This shiny app uses the UAH data to examine deviations of temperature from an average in various ways!
The UAH dataset explores lower trophospheric temperature data.

In the plot tab, users can select various regions to display them in an overlayed scatterplot.
There is also a text output of the regions selected and the number of regions selected!

In the table tab, users can choose a time frame (months, years, decades) to display the average deviations
of each timeframe from 1978-2023 relavtive to the average temperature of 1992-2020.
